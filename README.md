# Vaccination-Coverage
## Is vaccine coverage against other diseases decreasing due to rising vaccine hesitancy stoked by fears of the COVID-19 vaccine?
I wanted to take a quick look and evaluate if vaccine coverage against other diseases is suffering due to the rise in public discource around vaccine safety. The data in this analysis was sourced from data.gov, and was originally collected by the Department of Health and Human Services. This is a very surface level analysis and is mostly practice to see how real world datasets look like (e.g., not highly curated datasets from Kaggle).
