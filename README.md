# Vaccination Coverage
## Is vaccine coverage against other diseases decreasing due to rising vaccine hesitancy stoked by fears of the COVID-19 vaccine?
I wanted to take a quick look and evaluate if vaccine coverage against other diseases is suffering due to the rise in public discource around vaccine safety. The data in this analysis was sourced from data.gov, and was originally collected by the Department of Health and Human Services. This is a very surface level analysis and is mostly practice to see how real world datasets look like (e.g., not highly curated datasets from Kaggle).

Fortunately, from my analysis, this does not seem to be the case. At least for the three diseases included in this study (Pneumococcal, Tetanus, and Shingles), vaccine coverage is either holding steady or increasing since 2020 (for context, the first COVID-19 vaccines were released in late 2020, and controvertial vaccine mandates followed soon after).

Included in this repository is the original data file from data.gov and the Jupyter Notebook I used for the analysis.
